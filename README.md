# hello-world
Starting my GitHub journey with the time honored "Hello world." first project.

I'm Thomas Kee, an illustrator and graphic designer that moonlights as a software developer for various projects.
Much of my current work is in web developement, and thus need to write a lot of web code. I have ambitions in
the future for game developement. Please treat me kindly.
